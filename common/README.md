# PlanetSide Common Server Code
This project contains common code for the Login and World server roles. It also contains the reverse engineered packets and game types for the PlanetSide client.

## Build Requirements

* SBT 0.13.x
* Scala 2.11.7
* https://github.com/psforever/PSCrypto - binary DLL (Windows) or Shared Library (Linux) placed in the root directory of the project.

## Setting up a Build Environment
PSF-Common is built using Simple Build Tool (SBT), which allows it to be built on any platform. SBT is the Scala version of Make, but is more powerful as build definitions are written in Scala. SBT is distributed as a Java JAR and the only dependency it has is a JDK.

## Contributing
Please fork the project and provide a pull request to contribute code. Coding guidelines and contribution checklists coming soon.
